# Machine-Learning-with-Python
### A collection of python machine learning notebooks and datasets.

These notebooks serve as a template to get started using some of the many machine learning algorithms on small/simple datasets.

Many of these scripts are adapted from the Udemy course Machine Learning A-Z by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves. This course was an excellent first dive into the deep end of the theoretical background and implementation of machine learning models.
